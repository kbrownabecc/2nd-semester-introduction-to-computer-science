## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Do Now

* Students should take 5 minutes to follow the instructions on the Do Now in order to create/manipulate a user-defined function.  

### 2. Lesson

#### Abstraction

* Abstraction is managing the complexity of a program by removing details and pushing them down to a lower level
* Ask students to brainstorm why a function might be useful in programming.
  * Less repeated code.
  * Breaking the problem up into smaller pieces and solving each piece

#### Demonstration

* Demonstrate to students how you create a function using *def*, calling out the syntax and where arguments would go.
* Ask students how they would call your example function.
* Have students practice making a function that takes two arguments, adds them together, and returns the sum.

#### Function Contracts

* Introduce the concept of a function contract using `#`, which adds a comment (non-executed line of code)
* The function contract should
  * specify the name
  * explain the purpose
  * list what arguments it takes in and the types of those arguments
  * specify the return type

### 3. Lab

* Practice making a function that will take in a name as an argument and output the 'happy birthday song' to that name.
* Create a function that randomly selects 5 cards from a deck of cards (repeating allowed).

### 4. Debrief

* Check student progress and completion of the lab, wrap up by taking any final questions.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

If students are moving quickly, they could go back and use functions to improve an old project.
