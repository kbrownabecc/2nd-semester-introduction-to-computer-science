# Lesson 2.03: Conditionals

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Define and identify: `if, else, elif, conditionals, flow of control`
* Create chaining if statements

## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Do Now

* Project the Do Now on the board, circulate around the class to check that students are working and understand the instructions.
* Students should quickly realize that they do not have all the tools necessary to complete the task.
  
### 2. Lesson

#### Instruction

* Explain that in order to write useful programs, we almost always need the ability to check conditions and change the behavior of the program accordingly.
* **Conditional** statements give us this ability to affect the **flow of control**.
* The simplest form is the `if` statement. The Boolean expression after `if` is called the condition. If it is true, then the indented statement gets executed. If not, nothing happens.

    ```python
    if x > 0:
        print("x is positive")
    ```

#### Take a look at this example

   ```python
    animal = input("What is your favorite animal?")
    if animal == 'cat' or 'dog':
    print("A great pet!")
    else:
    print("Good choice")
   ```

#### Discussion

* Give students time to predict the output for various inputs in the above example.
* Discuss why the code is buggy
* fix it together as a class.

#### Demonstration

* Write out the syntax of the `if` statement on the board. Point out the Boolean expression(condition), the colon, and the indentation.
* Ask students if they recall what else went along with the if statement when they used it in Snap!
* `else` is used when there are two possibilities and the condition determines which one gets executed.
* Demonstrate the syntax of `else`
* Describe the `elif` statement
* Sometimes there are more than two possibilities and we need more than two branches. One way to express a computation like that is a chained conditional:
* Demonstrate the syntax of `elif`

### 3. Lab

* Students convert the triangle program written in Snap! into Python.
* Students must also write a program that simulates a list index using `if` statements.

### 4. Debrief

* Check student progress and completion of the lab, wrap up by taking any final questions.
* Have students write down a couple of learnings that they stood out to them today in their notebooks.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

Use the following as an extension activity for students that are moving quickly:

* Convert and finish the following SNAP Vending Machine program in Python.

If students are moving quickly, this lesson can move onto lists.
