# Lesson 3.04: Debugging and Scope

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Define and identify scope, aliasing, stack trace
* Demonstrate changing a list in a function updates the list outside of the function
* Demonstrate updating variables in a function does not affect the variable outside of the function
* Demonstrate using global variables
* Draw a simple stack trace

## Materials/Preparation

* [3.04 Slide Deck](https://github.com/TEALSK12/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/units/3_unit/slidedecks/Intro%20Python%203.04%20TEALS.pptx)
* [Do Now][]
* [Lab - Aliasing & Scope][] ([printable lab document][]) ([editable lab document][])
* Read through the do now, lesson, and lab so that you are familiar with the requirements and can assist students.
* [Associated Readings 3.4](https://tealsk12.github.io/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science/readings.md.html#associatedreadings/3.4)

| 10 Minutes | Debrief  |

## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Do Now

* Students have a chance to think about what & discuss what concepts they have been most challenged by.
* Next, students practice passing a list as an argument and updating that list within the function.

### 2. Lesson

* Discuss what students observed in the Do Now and take time, if needed, to go over questions about concepts that students find challenging.

#### Aliasing

* Explain the concept of **aliasing**.
* You can draw on the board a diagram of the variable pointing to a list.
* Note that when passing the location of a list you are not passing the actual value, so the list can be changed.
* **Video Explanation of Aliasing**

#### Scope of functions

* Explain to students that variable scope is the part of a program where a variable is accessible
* A variable which is defined in the main body of a file is called a global variable.

* **Video explanation of Variable Scope**

#### Global variables: variables defined outside of a function and used in many different functions

* To modify global variables defined outside the function you must declare the variable with the statement `global name_of_variable`.
* Any variable created inside of a function is a local variable.
* Variables in functions include the function parameters, the variables defined in the function and variables declared as global.
* Local variables of functions can't be accessed from outside when the function call has finished.
* Explain global variables are often used for constants.
* NOTE: We use the 'ALL CAPS' convention for global variables.

#### Conventions

* Discuss that programming languages frequently have **conventions**. It helps make code more readable, but isn't essential to functionality (in most cases). Here are some examples,
* camelCase for function names
* ALL_CAPS for global variables
 underscore_separated for variables

#### Stick Diagrams

* Demonstrate how to draw the Stack Diagrams shown in the course book ([found in section 3.4](https://tealsk12.gitbook.io/intro-cs-2/readings#stack-diagrams)) and explain how they show the scope of variables as they related to functions.
* Point out the error messages that will occur if you use a variable out of its scope.

#### Debugging

* Help students follow their program to understand how the code is working
* Explain how the use of print statements throughout your code can let you know where in the program things are not operating as expected.

### 3. Lab

* This lab has students running code that gets them thinking about aliasing and scope. They must also create a stack trace for a program to show their understanding of scope.

### 4. Debrief

* Take time to review the concepts covered today: **scope**, **aliasing**, and **stack traces**.
* Call a few students to the board to draw their stack traces from the lab and talk through them.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

If students are moving quickly, they can look ahead at the project spec or research the game Oregon Trail for context.
