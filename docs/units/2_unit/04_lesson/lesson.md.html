## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Do Now

* Students follow instructions to create lists and use the `len` function.

### 2. Lesson

#### Instruction

* Ask students to recall what a list is, and how lists were used in Snap!
* A **list** is a sequence of values. In a list, they can be any type. The values in a list are called elements or **items**.
* In Python, to create a list you must enclose items in square brackets.
* Emphasize that you can have lists of any type (`int, float, string, etc`). You can even have lists within lists (more on that later...)

#### Discussion

* Ask students what `len` does when they used it in the Do Now.
* Ask students how they tried to print the first item from a list. Was this what they were expecting?

#### More Instruction

* **index**: a map from the position in the list to the element stored there.
* **0-index**: lists are 0 indexed. So the first element in the list is at the 0-index
* **Out-of-bounds**: what happened when you tried to index into a list that was too long?

#### More Discussion

* Ask students how they would access the last item in a list of unknown length. (Use the length function!)
* Ask students to write on the board how they got the last element of a list. Ask another student to write how they would get the second to last element of the list and so on.

#### Demonstration

* After accessing any list element you can change it. Take a moment to demonstrate this syntax before starting the lab.

### 3. Lab

* Practice accessing and updating items in a list
* Implement program from last lab using lists
* Create a quiz program

### 4. Debrief

* Check student progress and completion of the lab, wrap up by taking any final questions.

## Accommodation/Differentiation

If students are moving quickly, you can introduce the topic of nested lists. Start off with a simple nested list like `['a', 'b', 'c', [1, 2, 3]]`. Ask the students to guess the length. Ask the students to guess how they would access the item '1' from that list!
