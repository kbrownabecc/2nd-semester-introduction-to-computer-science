# Lesson 1.02: Interactive Mode

## Learning Objectives

Students will be able to...

* Define and identify: **interpreter, string, integer, float, value, errors, console, expression**
* Use the Python interpreter to evaluate simple math expressions
* Distinguish between an integer, float, and string

## Materials/Preparation

* [1.02 Slide Deck](https://github.com/TEALSK12/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science/raw/master/units/1_unit/slidedecks/Intro%20Python%201.02%20TEALS.pptx)
* [Lab - Using the Interpreter][] ([printable lab document][]) ([editable lab document][])
* [Associated Reading - section 1.1](https://tealsk12.github.io/2nd-semester-introduction-to-computer-science/readings.md.html#associatedreadings/1.1)
* Ensure all students are able to log into the system
* Go through the lab so that you are familiar with the requirements/results and can assist students

## Pacing Guide

| **Duration**   | **Description**    |
| ---------- | -------------- |
| 5 Minutes  | Do Now         |
| 10 Minutes | Lesson         |
| 15 Minutes | Lab Part 1/Discussion |
| 20 Minutes | Lab Part 2/Discussion          |
| 5 Minutes | Debrief     |

## Instructor's Notes

### 1. Do Now

* Display the IDE and asks students to identify the key parts (menu bar items [run, console, +], code panel, console panel).
* After going over the three parts of the IDE have students check that they can still log into their IDE account.

### 2. Lesson

#### Guided Activity

* Have students all bring up their console on their computer
* The part on right half of the screen is called a **console**:
* The **console** is a place where you can interact with a program.
* The **interpreter** runs Python code.
* To run the Python interpreter, type code into the console and hit "Enter" or click "Run", the code executes immediately.
* Make sure all the students are able to do this and then give out the lab worksheet.

### 3. Lab Part 1

Give students time to work on section 1,

#### Discussion Section 1

* What does the // do? How is that different from /? And how are those different from %?
* What's the difference between 3.0 and 3?
* Go over the following two terms
  1. **Floats**: a data type, number with a decimal point.
  2. **Integers**: a data type, number without a decimal point.
* Now, give students time to work on section 2

#### Discussion Section 2

* What happened when you typed in a?
* What do you think that error message mean?
* Go over **String**: a data type, characters surrounded in single or double quotes.
* Now, give students time to work on section 3

#### Discussion Section 3

* What was the difference between the two inputs?
* Strings can be combined using `+`.
* What do you think the error message means?
* You can't combine different types!
* Now, give students time to work on section 4

#### Discussion Section 4

* What error did you get? What do you think that means?
* What happens when you multiply strings?

### 4. Lab Part 2

* Define **expression**: a combination of values and operators (and variables)
* Ask students to give an example of an expression
* Make sure students write down their predictions before going to the interpreter/IDE to check the actual output.

### 5. Debrief

* Discuss any surprising/unexpected results.
* Remind students of adding strings together using `+`.
* Talk about how single and double quotes are interchangeable
* Multiplying strings
* Order of Operations is the same as what students have learned in math class.
* Discuss why it might be helpful to have an interactive console. How is it different than snap?

### Accommodation/Differentiation

If students are moving quickly, have students practice higher order-of-operations problems. You can also have them practice assigning values to variables.
